## Project Description
The Receipt Management System is an automated solution designed to streamline the process of capturing and extracting information from receipts for expense reporting purposes. By implementing optical character recognition (OCR) technology and machine learning algorithms, the system aims to enhance user experience and improve efficiency in expense management.

## Key Features
- **Optical Character Recognition (OCR) Integration:** Utilize OCR technology to convert receipt images into machine-readable text.
- **Image Processing:** Develop algorithms for image processing to enhance the quality of receipt images.
- **Data Extraction Module:** AI-driven module for extracting relevant information from receipts such as merchant names, transaction dates, amounts, and itemized expenses.
- **Automatic Categorization:** Implement a feature for automatically categorizing expenses based on the extracted information.
- **Verification and Validation Checks:** Integrate validation checks to ensure accuracy and compliance with company expense policies.
- **Real-time Feedback Mechanism:** Design a feedback mechanism to provide users with real-time alerts regarding potential errors or missing data.
- **Integration with Expense Management Software:** Seamless integration with existing expense management software, such as SAP Concur, to auto-populate expense reports.
- **Mobile Accessibility:** Ensure the system works seamlessly on mobile devices, allowing users to capture receipts using smartphones.
- **Centralized Storage and Retrieval:** Create a centralized repository for storing and retrieving captured receipts, supporting auditing and reimbursement processes.
- **Learning and Improvement:** Incorporate machine learning capabilities for continuous improvement based on user corrections and feedback.

## Workflow
1. **Initiation:** Project kick-off, team alignment, and requirement clarification.
2. **Development Sprints:** Iterative development with regular sprint reviews and adjustments.
3. **Testing and Quality Assurance:** Comprehensive testing at each development stage to ensure functionality and reliability.
4. **Integration:** Integration with external systems, especially expense management software.
5. **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Involvement of end-users for testing the system in a real-world environment.
6. **Deployment:** Gradual deployment to ensure minimal disruption to users.
7. **Post-Implementation Review:** Evaluation of the project's success, addressing any post-deployment issues.
